This is a simple notebook for better understanding historical development of tuning.


================

Step 1: Understanding Ratios (a Mathematics drill)
Understanding concepts and ratios in each tuning system and temperament by answering questions.

Step 2: Listening to ratios
You can make sound of any intervals and scales and compare them. All you need to do is call the 'generate_dia_scale()' function and write down the ratios you want to listen to.

Step 3: Visualizing ratios
You can make any two sinewaves and compare them.
All you need to do is call the 'generate_n_compare_intervals()' function and write down the ratios of each interval.
