This is a simple notebook for better understanding historical development of tuning.


================

Step 1: Understanding Ratios (a Mathematics drill)
Understanding concepts and ratios in each tuning system and temperament by answering questions.

Step 2: Listening to ratios
Please do not change the code in the first cell.
You can make sound of any intervals and scales and compare them. All you need to do is call the 'generate_dia_scale()' function and write down the ratios you want to listen to.

Step 3: Visualizing ratios
Please do not change the code in the first cell.
You can make any two sinewaves and compare them.
All you need to do is call the 'generate_n_compare_intervals()' function and write down the ratios of each interval.
